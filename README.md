# camera_photo_renamer
A fast, cross-camera photo renamer powered by ExifTool. It safely renames RAW/JPEG/HEIF/PNG/TIFF photos using EXIF DateTimeOriginal and appends a counter for burst shots. Optionally prefixes filenames with a category and event, and creates XMP sidecars embedding the original filename in `XMP:Title` for traceability.
